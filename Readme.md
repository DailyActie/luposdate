# LUPOSDATE Semantic Web Database Management System

This is a [repository of LUPOSDATE](https://github.com/luposdate/luposdate), a Semantic Web Database Management System developed by [IFIS](http://www.ifis.uni-luebeck.de/) at the [University of Lï¿½beck](http://www.uni-luebeck.de/).

LUPOSDATE is a Semantic Web database supporting

- the RDF query language SPARQL 1.1
- the rule language RIF BLD
- RDFS and OWL2RL
- visual editing of SPARQL queries, RIF rules and RDF data
- visual representation of query execution plans (operator graphs), optimization and evaluation steps, and abstract syntax trees of parsed queries and rules

We support indexing for large-scale datasets (disk based) and for medium-scale datasets (memory based) as well as processing of (possibly infinite) data streams.
