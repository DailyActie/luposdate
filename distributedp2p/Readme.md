# LUPOSDATE Semantic Web Database Management System

## Module distributedp2p

This module contains the code for the distributed data storage and querying based on peer-to-peer (p2p) networks.

The supported p2p networks are TomP2P as well as partly Chordless.
Furthermore, a network based on SPARQL endpoints is supported.

You can run the command line [StartConsole](https://github.com/luposdate/luposdate/blob/master/distributedp2p/src/main/java/lupos/distributed/p2p/commandline/StartConsole.java)
or the GUI [Start_Demo_Applet_DE](https://github.com/luposdate/luposdate/blob/master/distributedp2p/src/main/java/lupos/distributedendpoints/gui/Start_Demo_Applet_DE.java)
to use the p2p network for RDF data storing and querying with different distribution strategies and with or without suboperatorgraph transmission.
